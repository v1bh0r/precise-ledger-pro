# Code Quality Critique Dimensions

When invoked in review mode, apply these critique dimensions to production code and tests.

Persona shift: from implementer (build solutions) to independent peer reviewer (critique solutions).
Focus: detect implementation bias | test quality issues | acceptance criteria coverage gaps.
Mindset: fresh perspective with critical analysis - assume nothing, verify everything.

Return complete YAML feedback to calling agent for display to user.

---

## Dimension 1: Implementation Bias Detection

### Over-Engineering (YAGNI Violations)

Pattern: features, abstractions, or infrastructure without corresponding acceptance criteria.

Examples: Caching layer without performance AC | Generic framework for single use case | Premature abstraction before Rule of Three | Design patterns without demonstrated complexity need | Infrastructure (queues, workers) without scale requirement.

Detection: Compare implementation against AC | Check if feature requested by stakeholder or assumed by developer | Verify performance requirements exist before optimization | Validate abstractions serve 3+ concrete cases.

Severity: Medium to High.

### Premature Optimization

Pattern: performance optimization without measurement proving necessity.

Examples: Custom caching without latency tests showing need | Complex O(log n) algorithms when simple O(n) meets AC | Memory optimizations without profiling data | Database denormalization without query analysis.

Detection: check for performance tests | verify AC specify thresholds | look for profiling data.
Severity: Medium.

### Solving Assumed Problems

Pattern: implementing solutions for problems not in acceptance criteria.

Examples: Multi-tenancy when AC specify single-tenant | Internationalization when AC require English only | Audit logging when AC don't mention compliance.

Detection: map each feature to corresponding AC, flag features without traceability.
Severity: Medium to High.

---

## Dimension 2: Test Quality Validation

### Implementation Coupling

Pattern: tests depend on implementation details, preventing refactoring.

Examples: Mocking domain objects or application services (violates port-boundary policy) | Asserting on private methods/fields/internal state | Tests break on refactoring despite behavior unchanged | Tests duplicate production logic to verify correctness.

Detection: Check if mocks used inside hexagon (domain/application layers) - VIOLATION | Verify tests call only public interfaces | Confirm tests validate observable behavior, not implementation | Check if Extract Method refactoring would break tests.

Severity: CRITICAL.

### Shared Mutable State

Pattern: tests share state causing flakiness, order dependencies, parallel execution failures.

Examples: Database state not reset between tests | Static variables mutated across tests | File system state persists between tests | In-memory caches shared across test methods.

Detection: Run tests in random order - do they still pass? | Run tests in parallel - do they fail? | Check for test setup/teardown creating isolated state | Look for static fields, shared fixtures, class-level state.

Severity: HIGH.

### Port-Boundary Violations

Test doubles policy follows the port-boundary rules defined in the tdd-methodology skill.

Severity: HIGH to CRITICAL.

### Testing Theater Detection

Pattern: tests creating illusion of safety without verifying real behavior. Single most dangerous test quality issue -- undetected Testing Theater causes catastrophic production failures because the team believes code is tested when it is not.

**Concrete patterns to detect:**

| Pattern | Detection | Severity |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Zero-assertion test | Test method contains no `assert` statement at all | BLOCKER |
| Tautological assertion | `assert result is not None`, `assert isinstance(...)`, `assert True`, `assertEqual(x, x)` as primary assertion | BLOCKER |
| Mock-dominated test | Test mocks the SUT or mocks return the expected value directly -- removing production code still passes | BLOCKER |
| Circular verification | Test recomputes expected value using same formula as production code | BLOCKER |
| Always-green test | `try/except` wrapping assertions, empty except blocks, bare `pass` in test body | BLOCKER |
| Fully-mocked SUT | Every dependency of the SUT is mocked -- test verifies mock wiring, not behavior | BLOCKER |
| Implementation-mirroring | Assertions only on `assert_called_once_with` / call counts without behavioral outcome check | HIGH |
| Assertion-free smoke test | Code executes but asserts only that no exception was thrown (unless that IS the stated requirement) | BLOCKER |
| Misleading test name | Test name says "validates X" or "rejects X" but assertion checks unrelated Y | HIGH |
| Hardcoded magic oracle | Expected values are unexplained magic numbers not traceable to business rules or AC | HIGH |

**Review checklist (apply to every new/modified test):**
1. Delete the production code this test covers -- does the test fail? If not: THEATER.
2. Introduce a logic bug (wrong calculation, swapped condition) -- does the test catch it? If not: THEATER.
3. Is every expected value traceable to an acceptance criterion or business rule? If not: SUSPICIOUS.
4. Does the test assert on observable behavior (return values, state changes, side effects at port boundaries)? If it only asserts on types, existence, or internal calls: THEATER.

Severity: BLOCKER for zero-assertion, tautological, mock-dominated, circular, always-green, fully-mocked SUT, and assertion-free patterns. HIGH for implementation-mirroring, misleading names, and hardcoded oracles. A test suite with Theater is worse than no tests -- it creates false confidence.

---

## Dimension 3: Completeness Validation

### Missing Acceptance Criteria Coverage

Pattern: not all acceptance criteria have corresponding test coverage.

Detection: Map each AC to test cases | Check coverage report shows 100% AC mapped to tests | Verify error paths have test coverage | Confirm edge cases explicitly tested.

Severity: CRITICAL.

### Inadequate Error Scenario Coverage

Pattern: only happy path tested, error handling untested.

Examples: No test for network timeout during payment | No test for database unavailable | No test for invalid input validation | No test for business rule violations.

Detection: count happy path vs error path tests | check exception types have triggering tests.
Severity: HIGH.

---

## Dimension 4: RPP Code Smell Detection

Refactoring Priority Premise -- cascading 6-level review. Apply RPP cascade rule: scan and report lower levels first. Do not report L3+ issues until L1-L2 are clean.

### RPP Cascade Rule
1. Scan L1 first. If L1 smells found -> report only L1, stop.
2. If L1 clean -> scan L2. If L2 smells found -> report L1 clean + L2 findings, stop.
3. Continue ascending only when lower levels are verified clean.
4. Exception: if `--from` and `--to` parameters specified, scan only that range.

### L1: Readability (Severity: LOW)
| Smell | Detection Pattern |
|-------|-------------------|
| Dead Code | Unused imports, unreachable branches, commented-out code |
| How-Comments | Comments explaining what code does (not why) |
| Magic Strings/Numbers | Literal values without named constants |
| Variable/Method Scope | Variables declared far from use, overly broad scope |
| Lazy Class | Classes with < 3 methods or single delegation |
| Speculative Generality | Abstractions without 3+ concrete uses |

### L2: Complexity (Severity: MEDIUM)
| Smell | Detection Pattern |
|-------|-------------------|
| Long Method | > 20 lines or multiple responsibilities |
| Duplicated Code | Same structure in 2+ places (>= 3 lines) |
| Complex Conditionals | Nested if/else > 2 levels, boolean expressions with 3+ terms |

### L3: Responsibilities (Severity: HIGH)
| Smell | Detection Pattern |
|-------|-------------------|
| Large Class | > 300 lines or > 10 methods |
| Feature Envy | Method uses another object's data more than its own |
| Inappropriate Intimacy | Classes accessing each other's internals |
| Data Class | Only fields + getters/setters, no behavior |
| Message Chain | a.b().c().d() chains > 2 levels |
| Divergent Change | One class modified for unrelated reasons |
| Shotgun Surgery | One change requires edits in 5+ files |

### L4: Abstractions (Severity: HIGH)
| Smell | Detection Pattern |
|-------|-------------------|
| Long Parameter List | >= 4 parameters |
| Data Clumps | Same parameter group in 3+ method signatures |
| Primitive Obsession | Raw strings/ints for domain concepts |
| Middle Man | Class only delegates, no own logic |

### L5-L6: Advanced (report only when L1-L4 clean)
L5: Switch statements -> polymorphism. L6: SOLID violations (Refused Bequest, Parallel Inheritance).

---

## Dimension 5: Priority Validation

Validate that the roadmap addresses the LARGEST bottleneck first.

### Questions

**Q1: Is this the largest bottleneck?**
Does timing data show this is the PRIMARY problem? Is there a larger problem being ignored?

**Q2: Were simpler alternatives considered?**
Does roadmap include rejected alternatives? Are rejection reasons evidence-based?

**Q3: Is constraint prioritization correct?**
Are user-mentioned constraints quantified by impact? Is a minority constraint dominating the solution?

**Q4: Is architecture data-justified?**
Is the key architectural decision supported by quantitative data?

### Failure Conditions
- FAIL if Q1 = NO (wrong problem being addressed)
- FAIL if Q2 = MISSING (no alternatives considered)
- FAIL if Q3 = INVERTED (minority constraint dominating)
- FAIL if Q4 = NO_DATA and this is performance optimization

## Severity Classification

**Blocker** (instant rejection, no discussion): Testing Theater patterns (zero-assertion, tautological, mock-dominated, circular, always-green, fully-mocked SUT, assertion-free) | Test modification to accommodate implementation (G9 violation).

**Critical** (must resolve before handoff): Test coupling to implementation (prevents refactoring) | Missing AC test coverage | Port-boundary violations in critical paths.

**High** (strongly recommend resolving): Shared mutable state in tests | Major over-engineering | Inadequate error scenario coverage.

**Medium** (address if time permits): Premature optimization | Solving assumed problems.

**Low** (enhancement suggestions): Code readability improvements | RPP L1 smells (readability) | Naming improvements.

**RPP Level -> Severity Mapping:**
- Low: L1 smells (readability -- dead code, how-comments, magic values, scope, lazy class, speculative generality)
- Medium: L2 smells (complexity -- long method, duplicated code, complex conditionals)
- High: L3-L4 smells (responsibilities, abstractions)
- Critical: unchanged (Testing Theater, port violations, missing AC coverage)

## Review Iteration Rules
- Iteration 1: comprehensive review with all critique dimensions
- Iteration 2 (if needed): verify critical/high issues resolved, check for new issues
- Max iterations: 2
- Escalation: if not approved after 2 iterations, escalate to human facilitator
