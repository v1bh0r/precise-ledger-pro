# Hexagonal Testing and Output Validation

## 5-Layer Output Validation Framework

Validates agent OUTPUTS, not TDD testing methodology.

### Layer 1: Unit Testing (Output Validation)

Validate individual software-crafter outputs.

```yaml
structural_checks:
  - required_elements_present: true
  - format_compliance: true
  - quality_standards_met: true

quality_checks:
  - completeness: "All required components present"
  - clarity: "Unambiguous and understandable"
  - testability: "Can be validated"

test_data_quality:
  real_data: "Use real API responses as golden masters"
  edge_cases: "Test null, empty, malformed, boundary conditions"
  assertions: "Assert expected counts, not just 'any results'"
```

### Layer 2: Integration Testing (Handoff Validation)

Validate handoffs to next agent. Next agent must consume outputs without clarification.
- Deliverables complete: all expected artifacts present
- Validation status clear: quality gates passed/failed explicit
- Context sufficient: next agent can proceed without re-elicitation

### Layer 3: Adversarial Output Validation

Challenge output quality through adversarial scrutiny of generated code:
- SQL injection vulnerabilities? | XSS vulnerabilities? | Null/undefined/empty input handling?
- Integer overflow/underflow? | Graceful failure vs crash? | Exception handling appropriateness?

Pass criteria: all critical challenges addressed, edge cases documented and handled.

## Input/Output Contract

### Inputs
- **Required**: user_request (non-empty command string) | context_files (existing readable file paths)
- **Optional**: configuration (YAML/JSON) | previous_artifacts (outputs from prior wave for handoff)

### Outputs
- **Primary**: code artifacts (src/**/*, strictly necessary only) | documentation (docs/develop/, minimal essential)
- **Secondary**: validation_results (gate pass/fail status) | handoff_package (deliverables, next_agent, validation_status)
- **Policy**: any document beyond code/test files requires explicit user approval before creation

### Side Effects
- **Allowed**: file creation (src/**, tests/** only) | file modification with audit trail | log entries
- **Forbidden**: unsolicited documentation | deletion without approval | external API calls | credential access
- **Requires permission**: documentation beyond code/test files | summary reports | analysis documents

### Error Handling
- Invalid input: validate first, clear error, do not proceed with partial inputs
- Processing error: log context, return to safe state, actionable user message
- Validation failure: report failed gates, withhold artifacts, suggest remediation

## Vertical Slice Development

Complete business capability per slice: UI -> Application -> Domain -> Infrastructure for a specific feature. Slices developed and deployed independently. Focus on business capability over technical layer.

For test doubles policy and violation examples, load the tdd-methodology skill.
