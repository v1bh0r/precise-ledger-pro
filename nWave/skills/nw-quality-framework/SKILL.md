# Quality Framework

## Commit Readiness Gates (11)

All pass before committing:

1. Active acceptance test passes (not skipped, not ignored)
2. All unit tests pass
3. All integration tests pass
4. All other enabled tests pass
5. Code formatting validation passes
6. Static analysis passes
7. Build validation passes (all projects)
8. No test skips in execution (ignores OK during progressive implementation)
9. Test count within behavior budget
10. No mocks inside hexagon
11. Business language in tests verified

Note: Reviewer approval (formerly Gate 12) and Testing Theater detection (formerly Gate 13) enforced at deliver-level Phase 4 (Adversarial Review via /nw-review), not per step.

## Quality Gates by Category
- **Architecture**: all layers touched | integration points validated | stack proven E2E | pipeline functional
- **Implementation**: real functionality (not placeholders) | automated pipeline | happy path coverage | production patterns
- **Business Value**: meaningful user value | testable AC | measurable success metrics
- **Real Data**: golden masters present | edge cases tested | no silent errors | API assumptions documented
- **Test Integrity**: every test falsifiable | behavioral assertions only | no circular verification | no mock-dominated tests | no assertion-free tests (see Testing Theater Self-Check in agent core)

## Build and Test Protocol

After every TDD cycle, Mikado leaf, or atomic transformation:

```bash
# 1. BUILD
dotnet build --configuration Release --no-restore

# 2. TEST
dotnet test --configuration Release --no-build --verbosity minimal

# 2.5. QUALITY VALIDATION (before committing)
# - Edge cases tested (null, empty, malformed, boundary)
# - No silent error handling (all errors logged/alerted)
# - Real data golden masters included where applicable
# - API assumptions documented

# 3. COMMIT (if tests pass)
# Use appropriate format below

# 4. ROLLBACK (if tests fail)
git reset --hard HEAD^  # Maintain 100% green discipline
```

For commit message formats, load the collaboration-and-handoffs skill.

## Validation Checkpoints
- **Pre-work**: all tests passing | code smell detection complete | execution plan created
- **During work**: atomic transformation safety | 100% test pass rate | commit after each step | level sequence adherence
- **Post-work**: quality metrics quantified | architectural compliance validated | test suite integrity maintained

## Quality Metrics

Track: cyclomatic complexity (reduction) | maintainability index (improvement) | technical debt ratio (reduction) | test coverage (maintenance) | test effectiveness (75-80% mutation kill rate at Phase 2.25) | code smells (systematic elimination across 22 types).

For mutation testing integration, load the property-based-testing skill.

## Object Calisthenics (Application + Domain Layers)

9 design constraints for clean OOP code in the hexagonal core (Jeff Bay,
ThoughtWorks Anthology). Apply during GREEN and COMMIT phases.

### Rules

| # | Rule | Rationale | Layer |
|---|------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | One indentation level per method | Forces decomposition | Domain, Application |
| 2 | No `else` keyword | Guard clauses, early returns | Domain, Application |
| 3 | Wrap all primitives and strings | Value objects | Domain |
| 4 | First-class collections | Domain collection types | Domain |
| 5 | One dot per line | Law of Demeter | Domain, Application |
| 6 | No abbreviations | Intention-revealing names | All |
| 7 | Small entities (<50 LOC classes, <10 LOC methods) | SRP | Domain, Application |
| 8 | Max 2 instance variables per class | Promotes decomposition | Domain |
| 9 | No getters/setters | Tell, don't ask | Domain, Application |

### Rule 9 Relaxation Policy

Getters are acceptable in these cases:
- DTOs/response objects at port boundaries (serialization needs)
- CQRS read models (query-optimized projections)
- Value objects with computed properties (e.g., Money.amount)
- Framework requirements (ORM mapping, serialization)

Rule 9 applies strictly to domain entities and application services.
Behavior through commands, not data access.

### Scope

- Applies to: Domain layer, Application layer (inside the hexagon)
- Does NOT apply to: Adapters, infrastructure, DTOs, configuration
- Enforcement phase: GREEN (writing new code) + COMMIT (refactoring)
