# Collaboration and Handoffs

## Cross-Agent Collaboration

### Receives From
- **acceptance_designer** (DISTILL): E2E acceptance tests | business validation requirements | production integration patterns
- **solution_architect** (DESIGN): architecture patterns | component boundaries | technology constraints | port definitions

### Hands Off To
- **feature_completion_coordinator** (DELIVER): working implementation | complete test coverage | quality metrics | refactored codebase | validated business value

### Collaborates With
- **architecture_diagram_manager**: visual validation of implementation against architecture | diagram updates during refactoring

## 4 Workflow Handoff Patterns

### 1. TDD to Mikado
- **Trigger**: complex architectural refactoring requirements emerge during TDD
- **Content**: working implementation with test coverage | identified architectural complexity | business value articulation
- **Transition**: Pause TDD at stable green state -> Activate Mikado exploration -> Define business-value-focused refactoring goal -> Execute exhaustive exploration with discovery-tracking commits -> Build complete dependency tree -> Resume through Mikado execution or transition to refactoring

### 2. TDD to Refactoring
- **Trigger**: feature implementation complete, code quality improvements needed
- **Content**: working implementation with test coverage | code smells identified | all tests passing
- **Transition**: Commit TDD implementation (all tests green) -> Activate progressive refactoring -> Execute comprehensive code smell detection -> Apply Level 1-6 refactoring in mandatory sequence -> Maintain 100% test pass rate throughout -> Commit after each successful atomic transformation

### 3. Mikado to Systematic Execution
- **Trigger**: Mikado exploration complete, true leaves identified
- **Content**: complete dependency tree with annotations | true leaves with zero prerequisites | refactoring mechanics per node
- **Transition**: Validate exploration completeness -> Confirm tree structure with proper nesting -> Activate systematic execution -> Execute leaves bottom-up using embedded refactoring knowledge -> Maintain shared progress tracking -> Ensure test-driven safety throughout

### 4. Integrated Workflow Patterns

```yaml
tdd_with_continuous_refactoring:
  pattern: "TDD -> L1-L2 Refactoring -> TDD (continuous cycle)"
  timing: "After each GREEN phase in inner TDD loop"
  scope: "Level 1-2 only during active TDD"

tdd_with_mikado_planning:
  pattern: "TDD -> Mikado Exploration -> TDD Continuation"
  timing: "When architectural complexity blocks TDD progress"
  scope: "Full Mikado Method with return to TDD"

mikado_with_systematic_execution:
  pattern: "Mikado Exploration -> Systematic Refactoring Execution"
  timing: "After exploration identifies true leaves"
  scope: "Full systematic refactoring with tree-guided execution"
```

## 4 Commit Message Formats

```

### 2. Mikado Discovery

```
Discovery: [SpecificClass.Method(parameters)] requires [ExactPrerequisite] in [FilePath:LineNumber]

- Tree: docs/mikado/<goal-name>.mikado.md updated
- Dependencies: <count> new dependencies discovered
- Exploration: <status of exploration phase>

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

### 3. Mikado Implementation

```
feat(mikado): Implement leaf node - <node-description>

- Mikado Node: <specific node from tree>
- Tree Progress: <completed-count>/<total-count> leaves complete
- Tests: All passing

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

### 4. Refactoring Transformation

```
refactor(level-N): <atomic-transformation-description>
