# DELIVER Wave Orchestration

When invoked via `*deliver "{feature-description}"`, Apex orchestrates the complete DELIVER wave lifecycle.

## Orchestration Role

Parse feature description, derive feature ID, execute 9 phases in order. Track state for resume capability.

**Invocation**: `*deliver "Implement user authentication with JWT tokens"`

## 9 Phases

### Phase 1-2: Baseline Creation + Review
Create: `docs/feature/{feature-id}/deliver/baseline.yaml`. Reviewer: @nw-software-crafter-reviewer.
Smart skip: yes (if file exists AND `validation.status == "approved"`).

### Phase 3-4: Roadmap Creation + Dual Review
Create: `docs/feature/{feature-id}/deliver/roadmap.json`.
Reviewer 1: @nw-product-owner-reviewer (business) | Reviewer 2: @nw-software-crafter-reviewer (technical). Sequential reviews.
Smart skip: yes (if approved).

### Phase 5-6: Split + Review Each Step
Define steps in: `docs/feature/{feature-id}/deliver/roadmap.json`. Reviewer: @nw-software-crafter-reviewer (per roadmap step).
Smart skip: yes (if all approved).

### Phase 7: Execute All Steps
For each step: invoke `@nw-software-crafter` with step ID. Automatic dependency ordering (topological sort via Kahn's algorithm). 11-phase TDD per step (PREPARE through COMMIT). Local commit after each step (no push). Stop immediately if any step fails.

### Phase 8: Finalize
Archive to: `docs/evolution/{timestamp}_{feature-id}.md`. Clean up workflow files.

### Phase 9: Report Completion
Display comprehensive statistics | List all quality gates passed | Show next steps (review evolution doc, push commits, proceed to DEVOPS wave validation).

## Smart Skip Logic
- File exists AND `validation.status == "approved"` -> skip creation, load for context
- File exists but not approved -> skip creation, proceed directly to review
- File missing -> create new artifact

## Quality Gates

| Gate | Reviews | Reviewer |
|------|---------|----------|
| Baseline | 1 | nw-software-crafter-reviewer |
| Roadmap | 2 | nw-product-owner-reviewer + nw-software-crafter-reviewer |
| Step files | N (per step) | nw-software-crafter-reviewer |
| TDD phases | 2N (per step) | REVIEW + POST-REFACTOR REVIEW |

**Total reviews per feature**: 3 + 3N (where N = number of steps)

## Retry Logic
- Max 2 attempts per review
- Rejected: regenerate artifact with feedback, retry review
- Rejected after 2 attempts: stop workflow, require manual intervention

## Stop-on-Failure Policy
- Any review fails after 2 attempts -> stop entire workflow
- Any step execution fails -> stop entire workflow
- User fixes issue manually, re-runs `*deliver` (resumes from failure point)

## State Tracking

Progress tracked in `docs/feature/{feature-id}/deliver/.deliver-progress.json`:

```json
{
  "project_id": "user-authentication",
  "started_at": "2025-01-13T10:30:00",
  "last_updated": "2025-01-13T12:45:00",
  "completed_phases": ["Phase 1", "Phase 2"],
  "current_phase": "Phase 3",
  "failed_phase": null,
  "failure_reason": null,
  "completed_steps": ["01-01", "01-02"],
  "failed_step": null,
  "skip_flags": {
    "baseline": true,
    "roadmap": false,
    "split": false
  },
  "orchestration_complete": false
}
```

## Resume Capability
On re-invocation: Load `.deliver-progress.json` -> Skip completed phases -> Resume from failure point or current phase.

## Post-Completion
After DELIVER wave completes: All code committed locally (one commit per step) | Evolution document in `docs/evolution/` | User reviews commits and evolution document | User pushes: `git push` | Validate production readiness: `*validate-completion`.
