# NW-DISCOVER: Evidence-Based Product Discovery

**Wave**: DISCOVER | **Agent**: Scout (nw-product-discoverer)

## Overview

Execute evidence-based product discovery through assumption testing and market validation. First wave in nWave (DISCOVER > DISCUSS > DESIGN > DEVOPS > DISTILL > DELIVER).

Scout establishes product-market fit through rigorous customer development using Mom Test interviewing principles and continuous discovery practices.

## Context Files Required

- docs/project-brief.md — Initial product vision (if available)
- docs/market-context.md — Market research and competitive landscape (if available)

## Previous Artifacts

None (DISCOVER is the first wave).

## Wave Decisions Summary

Before completing DISCOVER, produce `docs/feature/{feature-id}/discover/wave-decisions.md`:

```markdown
# DISCOVER Decisions — {feature-id}

## Key Decisions
- [D1] {decision}: {rationale} (see: {source-file})

## Constraints Established
- {constraint from evidence}

## Validated Assumptions
- {assumption validated by evidence, with confidence level}

## Invalidated Assumptions
- {assumption disproved, with evidence reference}
```

This summary enables downstream waves to quickly assess DISCOVER outcomes without reading all artifacts.

## Document Update (Back-Propagation)

Not applicable (DISCOVER is the first wave — no prior documents to update).

## Agent Invocation

@nw-product-discoverer

Execute \*discover for {product-concept-name}.

**Context Files:** docs/project-brief.md (if available) | docs/market-context.md (if available)

**Configuration:**
- interactive: high | output_format: markdown
- interview_depth: comprehensive | evidence_standard: past_behavior

## Success Criteria

## Next Wave

**Handoff To**: nw-product-owner (DISCUSS wave)
**Deliverables**: See Scout's handoff package specification in agent file
