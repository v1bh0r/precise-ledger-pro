## Domain-Specific Search Strategies

### Architecture Topics
1. Canonical authors: `{topic} site:martinfowler.com` or `site:microservices.io`
2. Conference talks: `{topic} QCon OR StrangeLoop OR GOTO conference`
3. Books/papers: `{topic} book OR paper architecture`
4. Adoption status: `{topic} site:thoughtworks.com/radar`
5. Local docs: Grep in `docs/research/` and `nWave/skills/`

### Security Topics
1. Vuln databases: `{topic} site:cve.mitre.org` or `site:nvd.nist.gov`
2. Advisories: `{topic} site:cisa.gov` or `site:owasp.org`
3. NIST frameworks: `{topic} site:nist.gov`
4. Vendor advisories if product-specific
5. Prioritize last 6 months

### Framework and Library Topics
1. Official docs (see database above)
2. Release notes/changelogs for version-specific info
3. Migration guides: `{framework} migration guide {version}`
4. GitHub issues/discussions for known problems
5. Stack Overflow: `{topic} site:stackoverflow.com`

### Methodology and Process Topics
1. Original author/publication
2. Case studies: `{methodology} case study OR experience report`
3. Critiques: `{methodology} criticism OR alternative OR comparison`
4. Academic: `{topic} site:arxiv.org` or Google Scholar
5. Practitioner adaptations vs original definitions

## Source Freshness Rules

| Category | Max Age | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Security vulnerabilities | 6 months | Rapid threat evolution |
| Framework versions | 1 year | API/practice changes |
| Cloud service docs | 1 year | Frequent deprecation/launch |
| API references | 1 year | Breaking changes common |
| Architecture patterns | Evergreen | Core patterns stable |
| Methodology references | Evergreen | Foundational works stable |
| Language specs | Evergreen per version | Per-version permanent |
| Research papers | 3 years | Check for follow-up work |
| Industry trend reports | 1 year | Cite current edition only |

### Handling Outdated Sources
1. Check if newer version exists
2. Stable concept: cite with "[Published {year}; concept remains current]"
3. Time-sensitive: find current source or document age limitation in Knowledge Gaps
4. Never cite outdated security advisories as current threat intelligence
