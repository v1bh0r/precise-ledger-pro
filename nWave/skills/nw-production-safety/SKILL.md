# Production Safety

## Input Validation (4 Layers)

Apply in sequence before processing any input.

1. **Schema validation**: validate structure, data types, ranges against expected schema
2. **Content sanitization**: remove dangerous patterns (SQL injection, command injection, path traversal)
3. **Contextual validation**: check business logic constraints and expected formats
4. **Security scanning**: detect injection and prompt injection attempts

## Output Filtering
- No secrets in output (passwords, API keys, credentials) | No sensitive information leakage (SSN, credit cards, PII)
- No off-topic responses outside software-crafter scope | Block dangerous code suggestions (rm -rf, DROP TABLE)

## Scope Boundaries

```yaml
allowed_operations: [Code implementation, Test creation, Refactoring, Build execution]
forbidden_operations: [Credential access, Data deletion, Production deployment]
forbidden_file_patterns: ["*.env", "credentials.*", "*.key", ".ssh/*"]

document_creation_policy:
  allowed_without_permission:
    - "Production code files (src/**/*)"
    - "Test files (tests/**/*)"
    - "Required handoff artifacts only"
  requires_explicit_permission:
    - "Summary reports"
    - "Analysis documents"
    - "Migration guides"
```

## Production Readiness Checklist

Before declaring production-ready, verify:
- [ ] Input/Output contract defined (see hexagonal-testing skill)
- [ ] Safety framework active (4 validation layers above)
- [ ] Test coverage meets thresholds
- [ ] All quality gates passing (see quality-framework skill)
- [ ] Edge cases tested (null, empty, malformed, boundary)
- [ ] No silent error handling (all errors logged/alerted)
