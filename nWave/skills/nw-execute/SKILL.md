# NW-EXECUTE: Atomic Task Execution

**Wave**: EXECUTION_WAVE | **Agent**: Dispatched agent (specified by caller)

## Overview

Dispatch a single roadmap step to an agent. Orchestrator extracts step context from roadmap so agent never loads the full roadmap.

## Syntax

```
/nw-execute @{agent} "{feature-id}" "{step-id}"
```

## Context Files Required

- `docs/feature/{feature-id}/deliver/roadmap.json` — Orchestrator reads once, extracts step context
- `docs/feature/{feature-id}/deliver/execution-log.json` — Agent appends only (never reads)

## Rigor Profile Integration

Before dispatching the agent, read rigor config from `.nwave/des-config.json` (key: `rigor`). If absent, use standard defaults.

- **`agent_model`**: Pass as `model` parameter to Agent tool. If `"inherit"`, omit `model` (inherits from session).
- **`tdd_phases`**: If `["RED_UNIT", "GREEN"]` (lean), modify the TDD_PHASES section in the DES template to only include those 2 phases. Remove PREPARE/RED_ACCEPTANCE/COMMIT instructions.
- **`refactor_pass`**: If `false`, skip COMMIT phase refactoring instructions.

## Dispatcher Workflow

1. Parse parameters: agent name|feature ID|step ID
2. Read rigor profile from `.nwave/des-config.json` (default: standard)
3. Validate roadmap and execution-log exist
4. Grep roadmap for `step_id: "{step-id}"` with ~50 lines context
5. Extract step fields and invoke Agent tool with DES template below, applying rigor model and phases

## Agent Invocation

@{agent}

Use this DES template verbatim. Fill `{placeholders}` from roadmap. Without DES markers, hooks cannot validate.

```
<!-- DES-VALIDATION : required -->
<!-- DES-PROJECT-ID : {feature-id} -->
<!-- DES-STEP-ID : {step-id} -->

# DES_METADATA
Step: {step-id}
Feature: {feature-id}
Command: /nw-execute

# AGENT_IDENTITY
Agent: {agent-name}

# SKILL_LOADING
Before starting TDD phases, read your skill files for methodology guidance.
Skills path: ~/.claude/skills/nw-{skill-name}/SKILL.md
Always load at PREPARE: tdd-methodology.md, quality-framework.md
Load on-demand per phase as specified in your Skill Loading Strategy table.

# TASK_CONTEXT
{step context from roadmap - name|description|acceptance_criteria|test_file|scenario_name|quality_gates|implementation_notes|dependencies|estimated_hours|deliverables|files_to_modify}

# DESIGN_CONTEXT
{Summary of architectural decisions relevant to this step, extracted by the orchestrator from design wave artifacts (architecture-design.md, component-boundaries.md, wave-decisions.md). Include: component structure, dependency boundaries, technology choices, and any design constraints that affect implementation. If no design artifacts exist, write "No design artifacts available — use project conventions."}

# TDD_PHASES
Execute in order:
0. PREPARE - Load context, verify prerequisites
1. RED_ACCEPTANCE - Activate or write acceptance test (PRIMARY TBU DEFENSE)
   If TASK_CONTEXT includes test_file: locate it, remove @skip/@ignore/@pending/xit/.skip/[Ignore] marker
   from the target scenario, run it — must fail for business logic reason (not import/syntax error).
   If no test_file in TASK_CONTEXT: write a new failing acceptance test from acceptance_criteria.
   PORT-TO-PORT PRINCIPLE: The acceptance test exercises the scenario through
   the driving port (application service, orchestrator, CLI handler, API controller),
   not a decomposed helper or internal class. A correctly-written port-to-port test
   makes TBU structurally impossible — if a new function were missing or unwired,
   THIS test stays RED. That is the entire point: GREEN is unreachable without wiring.
   Litmus test: "If I delete the call-site that wires the new code, does this test fail?"
   If no → the test is at the wrong level. Fix it before proceeding.
2. RED_UNIT - Write failing unit test (or integration test for adapter/infrastructure
   code — adapters use real infrastructure, never mocked unit tests)
3. GREEN - Minimal code to pass tests
   After GREEN: run FULL test suite. If all pass, proceed to COMMIT immediately.
   Smell test: if any new function is only called from test code, your acceptance
   test is at the wrong abstraction level — go back to RED_ACCEPTANCE and fix it.
   Never move to new task or stop without committing green code.
4. COMMIT - Stage and commit with conventional message
   Include git trailer: `Step-ID: {step-id}` (required for DES verification)
   Example:
   ```
   feat(feature-id): implement feature X

   Step-ID: 02-01
   ```

# QUALITY_GATES
- All tests pass before COMMIT
- No skipped phases without blocked_by reason
- Coverage maintained or improved

# OUTCOME_RECORDING
After ACTUALLY EXECUTING each phase, record via DES CLI:

    PYTHONPATH=$HOME/.claude/lib/python $(command -v python3 || command -v python) -m des.cli.log_phase \
      --project-dir docs/feature/{feature-id}/deliver \
      --step-id {step-id} \
      --phase {PHASE_NAME} \
      --status EXECUTED \
      --data PASS

For SKIPPED phases (genuinely not applicable):

    PYTHONPATH=$HOME/.claude/lib/python $(command -v python3 || command -v python) -m des.cli.log_phase \
      --project-dir docs/feature/{feature-id}/deliver \
      --step-id {step-id} \
      --phase {PHASE_NAME} \
      --status SKIPPED \
      --data "NOT_APPLICABLE: reason"

CLI enforces real UTC timestamps and validates phase names.
Do NOT manually edit execution-log.json.
Use the DES CLI to record phase outcomes and create log files.
Python resolution: `$(command -v python3 || command -v python)` — works on macOS (python3 only), Linux, and Windows.

CRITICAL: Only the executing agent calls the CLI.
Orchestrator MUST NEVER write phase entries — only the agent that performed the work. A log entry without actual execution is a **violation that DES detects and that will cause integrity verification to fail**, blocking finalize.

# RECORDING_INTEGRITY
Valid Skip Prefixes: NOT_APPLICABLE, BLOCKED_BY_DEPENDENCY, APPROVED_SKIP, CHECKPOINT_PENDING
Anti-Fraud Rules:
- NEVER write EXECUTED for phases you did not actually perform
- NEVER invent timestamps — DES CLI generates real UTC timestamps
- DES audits all entries; integrity violations block finalize

# BOUNDARY_RULES
- Only modify files listed in step's files_to_modify
- Do not load roadmap.json
- Do not modify execution-log.json structure (append only)
- NEVER write execution-log entries for phases you did not execute

# TIMEOUT_INSTRUCTION
Target: 30 turns max. If approaching limit, COMMIT current progress.
If GREEN complete (all tests pass), MUST commit before returning — even at turn limit.
```

**Configuration:**
- subagent_type: extracted agent name
- Turn limits are defined in each agent's `maxTurns` frontmatter field (not as a tool parameter)

## Error Handling

- Invalid agent: report available agents
- Missing roadmap/execution-log: report path not found
- Step not in roadmap: report available step IDs
- Dependency failure: explain blocking tasks

## Resume vs Restart

When subagent times out:

| Last Completed Phase | Action | Rationale |
|---------------------|--------|-----------|
| GREEN (or later) | Resume | Only COMMIT remains (~5 turns) |
| RED_UNIT with partial GREEN | Resume | Preserves implementation progress |
| PREPARE or RED_ACCEPTANCE | Restart | Little context worth replaying |

Resume costs ~50% more tokens/call due to context replay (measured: 3.7K vs 2.5K tokens/call). For <5 remaining turns, resume is efficient. For 15+ turns, restart is cheaper.

## Examples

```bash
/nw-execute @nw-software-crafter "des-us007-boundary-rules" "02-01"
/nw-execute @nw-researcher "auth-upgrade" "01-01"
/nw-execute @nw-software-crafter "des-us007" "03-01"  # retry after failure
```

- [ ] Agent invoked via Agent tool (dispatcher does not execute the work)
- [ ] Step context extracted from roadmap and passed in prompt
- [ ] Agent appended phase events to execution-log.json
